# lambdb
Because people tend to write code that only works with databases that support SQL, or worse code that only works with a few DBs or even just 1. Recently this has begun to piss me off. Let me see if i can create a *db proxy. i dont even know where this will end up, but hopefully it makes people less reliant on SQL. maybe in the future SQLfags and JSONfags may live together in harmony and a stack will not be dictated by a single server, software or other faggotry. may the legacy infrastructure live happily ever after in document datastores or relational dbs.


# how it works
idfk..

planning on emulating clickhouse api so drivers are already around for almost
any language, but i will likely add another api that is less wasteful than
http based bullshit.


consider this a protest of SQL being a standard. yeah its cool, but this is 2018 so why the fuck are we still using strings to query dbs?
if you think that is illogical, read the LICENSE file and then hook up some SQL shit to anything.

we have very strict coding standards for pull requests, they are as follows:

we dont give a fuck, write shit how you want.

then pass it through yapf with the default options. boom, that is all i care about.

oh yeah, but fuck spaces
