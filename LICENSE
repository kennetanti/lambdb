   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION

  0. You just DO WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT TO as long as you NEVER LEAVE
A FUCKING TRACE TO TRACK THE AUTHOR of the original product to blame for
or held responsible.
  1. If any large corporate entities decide to take action against the
person who is responsible for this project, regardless whether the reason
is from threatening the influence of their products, a direct attack on
them, encouraging the ability to migrate to other products or any reason
what so ever, the person who wrote this does not care about their feelings.
A company should not be the powerhouse of an industry only because "if we
want x app, then we have to make everything use y backend".
  2. If you want to use this software for a purpose other than it was intended,
feel free. That is the best way to use softwares. If you make a million dollars
off of my hard work and time spent not hanging out with my friends, at least
give me some of that money... or a fucking job. Hell, give me a job anyways.
  3. this is really not a very good license file, but nobody fucking reads this
anyways. If you are reading this right now, quit wasting time you could be
spending overthrowing the IRS. (idgaf about the rest of the government. usually.
but man fuck taxes, im not paying you. if you were doing something we need,
we would give you money willingly and you would not have to blackmail everybody.
litterally wtf am i paying you for? i pay you to throw my ass in jail? man fuck
you and your fuckin authority)
